			<br><br><p>There are about 60 crocheters working at sulci.<br>
I usually crochet bags at home, but when I came to the workshop, I learned how to<br>
iron bags and how to crochet them, and sometimes I took a break from crocheting to have a chat, and the students always had fun crocheting bags. I'm reading.</p>

			<h3>Initiatives that lead to skill improvement</h3> <br><br>
			<p>In order to maximize the potential of our crocheters, Sulci
not only teaches them how to crochet bags, but also provides a variety of follow-up support.</p>
			<br><br><h7>Bag Design Competition</h7><br><br><br><br>
			<h5>This competition has been held every year since 2014 because we want crocheters to become bag designers as well.<br>
The crocheters design their own bags and crochet them into shapes, which are judged and commented on by representative Sekiya at the Christmas party.<br>
Prizes, certificates, and supplementary prizes will be awarded to the top five entries, and the best entries may even be commercialized.<br>
Our design capabilities and techniques have improved year by year, and unique pieces are being created.<br>
Through competitions, we hope that participants will not only improve their skills, but also expand their own potential and gain confidence.</h5>

			<br><br><h7>Fashion Show</h7><br><br><br>
			<h5>We have been holding this event once every two years since 2017, hoping that the crocheters will feel a sense of fulfillment and pride in their work.<br>
In addition to special effects such as sound and lighting, professional singers and dancers will also appear to liven up the venue. The glamor and excitement is reminiscent of a Paris fashion show.<br>
The crocheters carried the bags they had created in the above competition and walked the runway in front of an audience of approximately 300 people, including friends and family, as well as Sulusi's caregivers and members of the local media. walk.<br>
It will be an unforgettable and moving day not only for the crocheters themselves, but also for their husbands and children.</h5>

			<h3>Sulci's Events</h3><br><br>
			<p>At Surushi, we hold various events to deepen the bonds and friendships between crocheters.</p>
			<br><br><h7>Christmas Party</h7><br><br><br>
			<h5>The Philippines is the only Christian country in Asia, with over 90% of the population being Christians. Christmas parties are a big event for these people, and Surushi also holds a grand party in the garden of the workshop on the second or third Saturday of December.<br>
On this day, the crocheters' children and their husbands also participate, making it a lively and fun party with games, dancing, gift exchange, and karaoke.<br>
The highlight of the party was lechon, a roasted pig that is a staple at parties in the Philippines!<br>
With cheers, laughter, and singing, the party continues until nightfall.</h5>
