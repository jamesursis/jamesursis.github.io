			Sulci is an "ethical and fair trade" bag brand that was launched in the summer of 2012. The brand's founder spent two years in the Philippines, specifically in Cebu and Bohol, teaching local women how to crochet, design bags, and providing technical guidance. The goal of Sulci is to create sustainable employment opportunities for local women who may not have jobs, allowing them to work while managing household responsibilities. Sulci aims to empower these women, boost their self-confidence, and highlight the potential and resources available in developing countries. The brand is committed to supporting its producers, improving bag design and quality, and making their products accessible to a wider customer base. Sulci introduced the use of raffia for crochet in the Philippines, offering a flexible working environment that doesn't require heavy machinery or a specific location.

			<h3>HISTORY</h3>

			The Sulci story started when Satomi Sekiya who has always been an expart and a hobbyist in crochet and now a Sulci representative, visited the Philippines in 2010 and saw the situation of local women, who were willing to work but could not find a place of work. Sekiya then decided to develop a way for local women to earn income and be independent through bag making. It has been nearly two years since she taught local women crocheting skills from the basics, such as how to hold a crochet hook and explaining crocheting patterns. Sulci built up its trust and relationship with local women increasing quality to the point where it began to sell its products in 2012. It was Sulci that introduced the use of Raffia for crocheting with a crochet hook as it had traditionally been used for weaving only. This method allowed the freedom of working from home, relieving the requirement for investment in machinery or a factory.

This means women, who are doing the crochet inside their homes, can get P2000 in a week.
